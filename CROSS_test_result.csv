pubmed23n0001_2656,"Suppression and stimulation mechanisms controlling glucagon secretion in a case of islet-cell tumor producing glucagon, insulin, and gastrin.","The mechanisms controlling secretion of glucagon and other pancreatic hormones were studied in a patient affected with multihormone-secreting islet-cell tumor. Fasting glucagon levels (3,000 pg./ml.) rose to 10 ng./ml. following arginine stimulation. While oral glucose load and intravenous glucose infusion did not suppress glucagon secretion, insulin administration induced a prompt depression in glucagon levels. Glucagon, insulin, and gastrin levels were suppressed by somatostatin while calcium infusion caused a paradoxical increase. It is suggested that only some of the stimulation-inhibition mechanisms were conserved in this case of glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor.","Suppression and stimulation mechanisms controlling glucagon secretion in a case of islet-cell tumor producing glucagon, insulin, and gastrin.

pubmed23n0001_445,Value of capillary blood gas analyses in the management of acute respiratory distress.,"A comparative study of blood gases and acid-base parameters, obtained simultaneously from arterial and finger capillary samples, was performed in 45 patients in acute respiratory distress without circulatory shock. Although small and significant differences were found between the 2 sample pH, Po2, Pco2, and bicarbonate values, the correlations between the 2 were greater than or equal to 0.97 for each variable. It was concluded that although the arterial blood is the preferred sample for evaluation of blood gases and acid-base status of patients in acute respiratory distress, capillary blood appears to be a valid substitute in the management of these patients. This technique is particularly valuable in pediatric practice, where repeated arterial samples are less easily obtained.","Value of capillary blood gas analyses in the management of acute respiratory distress.

pubmed23n0001_6097,Putative neurotransmitters of the avian visual pathway.,"The ability of homogenates of the chick optic lobe to accumulate a series of possible neurotransmitters has been studied. High affinity uptake of several possible neurotransmitters was examined in optic lobes of 21-day-old embryos that had a single eye removed on the third day of incubation and in 23-day-old chicks that had an eye removed at hatch. Embryonic enucleation resulted in severe reduction of development of the ability of the contralateral optic lobe to take up tritiated GABA, dopamine, choline, serotonin and glutamate from solutions around 10(-8)M. Unilateral eye removal of new-hatched chicks caused failure of the denervated optic lobe to grow, but only the uptake capacity for glutamate was significantly recuced. This deficit was apparent as early as 4 days after enucleation. The transport of other compounds was unimpaired. The uptake of glutamate by homogenates of the optic tract was 43% of that or the optic lobe. This was a much greater fraction than the corresponding value for other postulated neurotransmitters. These data suggest that glutamate may be the primary neurotransmitter of the fibers of the optic tract originating in the retinal ganglion cells.","Putative neurotransmitters of the avian visual pathway.

pubmed23n0001_7752,Protective action of timolol in acute myocardial ischemia.,"Timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with little or no cardiodepressant activity, was studied in acute myocardial ischemia in cats. Timolol, at a dose of 25 mug/kg, blocked 75 to 80% of the cardiac response to isoproterenol. This dose also significantly reduced heart rate in cats subjected to acute myocardial ischemia by ligation of the left coronary artery. Timolol significantly prevented the spread of ischemic damage in the myocardium as assessed by (a) curtailing the increase in plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity, (b) preventing the loss of CPK from the ischemic portion of the myocardium, and (c) restoring the elevated S-T segment of the electrocardiogram toward normal. Timolol did not significantly retard the increase in fragility of lysosomes in ischemic myocardial tissue. The mechanism of the protective effect to timolol on the ischemic myocardium appears to be via reducing myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate.","Protective action of timolol in acute myocardial ischemia.

Biochemical and genetic evidence for two distinct enzyme activities.,"Various properties of the steroid 5alpha-reductase have been examined in cell-free extracts of skin and of fibroblasts cultured from genital and nongenital skin from control subjects and from patients with several forms of male pseudohermaphroditism. When 20alpha-hydroxy-4-[1,2-3H] pregnen-3-one was used as substrate, two 5alpha-reductase activities could be demonstrated in intact skin and cultured fibroblasts. The major activity, previously described for microsomes from human prepuce and extracts of cultured foreskin fibroblasts, is characterized by a narrow pH optimum near 5.5 and is limited to fibroblasts derived from genital skin. A second activity, not limited by the site of biopsy, has been demonstrated over a higher and broader range of pH (from 7 to 9); this enzyme activity is found in both genital and nongenital skin and in fibroblasts cultured from all skin regions. Whereas there is wide variability in the activity at pH 5.5 in genital skin fibroblasts, the activity at pH 7 to 9 is similar in fibroblasts derived from all anatomical sites. The two activities exhibit different kinetics with respect to steroid substrate and are also dissimilar in their subcellular distributions.

pubmed23n0001_6243,pH-dependent effects of Cr(NH3)2ATP on kinetics of yeast hexokinase PII. Relationship to the slow transition mechanism.,"The effect of Cr(NH3)2ATP, a virtually inert, inner sphere metal-ligand complex, on the kinetics of purified yeast hexokinase PII has been studied at pH 6.5 and pH 7.5. At pH 6.5, where the normal assays exhibit a slow burst-type transient, low concentrations of Cr(NH3)2ATP were found to activate both phii, the initial velocity, and phiII, the steady state velocity. At higher concentrations, Cr(NH3)2ATP was found to be a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP for both phii and phiII. The apparent Ki values for both velocities were the same. The inhibition by Cr(NH3)2ATP at pH 6.5 was found to be a slow process with half-times similar to those found for the normal burst-type transient at this pH value. At pH 7.5, where normal assays exhibit linear progress curves, Cr(NH3)2ATP behaved similarly to that observed before at pH 7 (Danenberg, D. D., and Cleland, W. W. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 28-39), i.e. it was a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP and it caused a slowing of the reaction rate over the first several minutes. The apparent Ki for the initial velocity was 8-fold higher than the apparent Ki for the steady state velocity, suggesting tighter binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time. Preincubation experiments indicated that the normal pH 6.5 burst-type transient could be eliminated by appropriate preincubation with Cr(NH3)2ATP and a sugar. In agreement with Danenberg and Cleland (1975), similar preincubations have been shown to produce linear assays at pH 7.5 in the presence of Cr(NH3)2ATP. Similar results were seen with MgITP as the nucleotide substrate, where a burst-type transient is not seen at either pH value under normal assay conditions. At pH 7.5, a slow decrease in the reaction rate is seen over the first several minutes in the presence of Cr(NH3)2ATP. The apparent Ki for phii was 7-fold higher than the apparent Ki value for phiII, again suggesting a tighter binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time. A similar observation was made at pH 6.5, but the Ki values for phii and phiII were the same, suggesting no tightening of the binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time at this pH value. These results suggested that both slow processes reflect the same basic molecular change, but the consequences are different at the two pH values, presumably because of the difference in the charge of the enzyme. The Cr(NH3)2ATP kinetics at pH 6.5 have been interpreted in terms of a modification of the slow transition mechanism for hexokinase (Shill, J. P., and Neet, K. E. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2259-2268). It is postulated that glucose and Cr(NH3)2ATP induce the same slow conformational change at pH 6.5 as that induced by glucose and MgATP, which gives rise to the normal burst-type transient. This suggests that Cr(NH3)2ATP may be a useful tool for physical studies to determine the cause of the slow transition of yeast hexokinase. Activation by low concentrations of Cr(NH3)2ATP was interpreted as binding of the nucleotide to an activator site on the enzyme, causing a shift in the distribution of enzyme towards the more active form.","pH-dependent effects of Cr(NH3)2ATP on kinetics of yeast hexokinase PII.

pubmed23n0001_3126,Determination of ionized calcium in serum that has been exposed to air.,"We examined changes in ionized calcium concentration in serum after its exposure to air. Samples with total protein concentrations ranging from 50 to 90 g/liter were equilibrated with CO2 in nitrogen (5/95, by vol) or CO2 alone, to produce pH values of 7.0 to 8.0. Ionized calcium was then measured with an Orion flow-through electrode system. Curves relating pH and ionized calcium concentration had statistically identical slopes regardless of protein concentration. A factor was derived, based on pH change, for correcting values for ionized calcium in serum exposed to air, and its validity was confirmed by comparing corrected values for samples allowed to stand at ambient temperature (23 degrees C) without anaerobic precautions with values initially obtained on anaerobic aliquots of the same samples.","Determination of ionized calcium in serum that has been exposed to air.

pubmed23n0001_4056,Steady-state studies of the actin-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity of myosin.,"Reconstituted actomyosin (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) (0.400 mg F-actin/mg myosin) in 10.0 muM ATP loses 96% of its specific ATPase activity when its reaction concentration is decreased from 42.0 mug/ml down to 0.700 mug/ml. The loss of specific activity at the very low enzyme concentrations is prevented by the addition of more F-actin to 17.6 mug/ml. It is concluded that at low actomyosin concentrations the complex dissociates into free myosin with a very low specific ATPase activity and free F-actin with no ATPase. The dissociation of the essential low molecular weight subunits of myosin from the heavy chains at very low actomyosin concentrations may be a contributing factor. Actomyosin has its maximum specific activity at pH 7.8-8.2. The Km for ATP is 9.4 muM, which is at least 20-fold greater than myosin's Km for ATP. The actin-activated ATPase of myosin follows hyperbolic kinetics with varying F-actin concentrations. The Km values for F-actin are 0.110 muM (4.95 mug/ml) at pH 7.4 and 0.241 muM (10.8 mug/ml) at pH 7.8. The actin-activated maximum turnover numbers for myosin are 9.3 s-1 at pH 7.4 and 11.6 s-1 at pH 7.8. The actomyosin ATPase is inhibited by KCl.

Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) is such a promutagen. It has no effect on cell growth or mutant frequency when incubated alone with L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, but exerts both mutagenic and toxic effects when incubated in a microsome reaction mixture. Microsomes were prepared from C3H/f We 16-wk-old male mice by the calcium preciptation technique. L5178Y continuously cultured mouse lymphoma cells heterozygous for thymidine kinase (TK+/-) were incubated for 15 min with calcium-precipitated microsomes and various concentrations of DMN in appropriate reaction mixtures. After a 48-hr expression time, treated cells were cloned in soft agar with and without bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) (50 mug/ml); 10 days later colonies grown to greater than about 200 mum diameter were counted. The frequency of BUdR-resistant (mutant) colonies increased linearly with the DMN concentration. A reconstruction experiment showed that the assay conditions did not significantly alter the relationship between parent and BUdR-resistant cells in growth and cloning efficiency. The smallest dose of DMN used in these experiments was 100mumol/liter, the one-sided (100 mumol greater than control frequency) -p value is 0.036. The locus is extremely sensitive to mutagenesis by DMN compared with other known mutagens at similar levels of cell survival.","Bromodeoxyuridine resistance induced in mouse lymphoma cells by microsomal activation of dimethylnitrosamine.

Isoproterenol, given 30 seconds prior to histamine challenge, reproducibly blocked histamine-induced dynamic compliance decreases and increased heart in the artificially ventilated guinea pig. These effects were used to separate the activity of beta adrenergic blockers on airway and heart muscle. Dose-response data were obtained and ED50 values for pulmonary and cardiovascular blockade were compared. Relative potencies and cardioselectivity ratios for dichloroisoproterenol, practolol, dl-propranolol and d-propranolol were determined. Both practolol and dichloroisoproterenol were cardioselective; dl-propranolol was found to be the most potent. When a similar protocol was tried in the rabbit, isorpoterenol failed to antagonize either histamine or methacholine-induced airway constriction. This finding was supported in subsequent in vitro tests. Isoproterenol and epinephrine were ineffective in blocking methacholine-induced tracheal chain contractions and epinephrine did not significantly enhance adenylate cyclase activity.

Effects of ligands upon the Raman spectra of various C-type cytochromes.,"Resonance Raman spectra were measured for various C-type cytochromes (mammalian cytochrome c, bacterial cytochrome c3, algal photosynthetic cytochrome f, and alkylated cytochrome c) and a B-type cytochrome (cytochrome b5) in their reduced and oxidized states. (1) For ferrous alkylated cytochrome c, a Raman line sensitive to the replacement of an axial ligand of the heme iron uas found around 1540 cm=1. This ligand-sensitive Raman line indicated the transition from acidic (1545 cm-1) to alkaline (1533 cm-1) forms with pK 7.9. The pH dependence of the Raman spectrum corresponded well to that of the optical absorption spectra. (2) For ferrous cytochrome f, the ligand-sensitive Raman line was found at the same frequency as cytochrome c (1545 cm-1). Accordingly two axial ligands are likely to be histidine and methionine as in cytochrome c. (3) For ferrous cytochrome c3, the frequency of the ligand-sensitive Raman line was between those of cytochrome c and cytochrome b5. Since two axial ligands of the heme iron in cytochrome c3 might be histidines. However, a combination of histidine and methionine as a possible set of two axial ligands was not completely excluded for one or two of the four hemes. (4) In ferrous cytochrome b5, two weak Raman lines appeared at 1302 and 1338 cm-1 instead of the strongest band at 1313 cm-1 of C-type ferrous cytochromes. This suggests the practical use of these bands for the identification of types of cytochromes. The difference in frequency and intensity between B- and C-types of hemes implies that the low effective symmetry of the heme in ferrous cytochrome c is due to vibrational coupling of ring modes with peripheral substituents rather than geometrical disortion of heme.","Resonance Raman scattering from hemoproteins.

pubmed23n0001_4566,Conformational changes in subfractions of calf thymus histone H1.,"This paper presents the first study of conformational changes in the subfractions of calf thymus H1. H1 was fractionated by the method of Kincade and Cole (Kincade, J. M., and Cole, R.D. (1966), J. Biol. Chem. 241. 5790) using a very shallow Gdn-HC1 gradient. A possible new H1 subfraction, about 5--8% of the H1, has been found and characterized by amino acid analysis and electrophoresis. The effects of salt concentration and pH on the conformation of each of the four major subfractions have been studied by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of the tyrosine emission and the circular dichroism (CD) of the peptide bond. Upon the addition of salt to aqueous solutions at neutral pH, all four subfractions show an instantaneous change in fluorescence anisotropy, fluorescence intensity, tyrosine absorbance, and CD. The folding associated with this instantaneous change is highly cooperative, and involves the region of the molecule containing the lone tyrosine, which becomes buried in the folded form. The folding of subfraction 3a is more sensitive to salt than the other major subfractions. Upon folding, approximately 13% of the residues of subfractions 1b and 2 form alpha and beta structure; 3a and 3b have approximately 16% of the residues in alpha and beta structures. There is no evidence for interactions between the subfractions. In salt-free solutions, each of the four major subfractions show very little change in conformation in going from low to neutral pH, but each shows a very sharp transition near pH 9. This transition gives rise to a marked increase in fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence intensity, and involves the formation of both alpha and beta strucute in a manner similar to that of the salt-induced state.","Conformational changes in subfractions of calf thymus histone H1.

pubmed23n0001_9353,Drug utilization review in an HMO. I. Introduction and examples of methodology.,"An experimental drug utilization review program was developed for a health maintenance organization (HMO). The objectives of the program were to develop and implement an ongoing mechanism for reviewing drug use using criteria based on the scientific literature, and to evaluate the effect of the drug use review program on physician precribing patterns. Seven therapeutic categories of drugs, accounting for over 65 per cent of prescribing, were selected and criteria developed for their use. The drug use review prcedure is described briefly. The evaluation of the drug use review program is based on a comparison of rates of prescription use for specific therapeutic categories before and after the criteria were ceveloped and approved. As an example, data for the antihistamine therapeutic category are presented. Criteria for prescribing antihistamines suggested restricting use of combination cold preparations and refraiming from antihistamine use in viral upper respiratory tract infections. After the criteria were adopted, prescribing of antihistamines for viral URIs declined, particularly in pediatrics. In general, prescribing of combination antihistamine preparations did not change; where one combination preparation was deleted from the formulary, prescribers appeared to substitute another combination preparation.","Drug utilization review in an HMO.

pubmed23n0001_6890,Neurochemical responses of mice to ACTH and lysine vasopressin.,"Subcutaneous administration of ACTH 1-24 to mice increased the incorporation of [3H]lysine into brain and liver proteins, an effect which resembled that due to footshock. Corticosterone administration did not mimic these effects. ACTH 4-10 increased the [3H]lysine incorporation into brain or liver. These results are consistent with ACTH mediating the effects of footshock. However, dexamethasone decreased the brain responses to both footshock and ACTH, but while the liver response to ACTH was blocked, the footshock response was only diminished. This suggests a neural component in the response of the liver and possibly the brain. Intraventricular administration of ACTH 1-24 or ACTH 4-10 (D-phe), but not ACTH 4-10, increased [3H]lysine incorporation into brain protein. These neurochemical responses parallelled a distinctive pattern of behavior characterized by stretching, yawning and excessive grooming. Treatment for 3 days with long-acting preparations of ACTH 4-10, ACTH 4-10 (D-phe) or ACTH 1-24 increased the conversion of [3H]tyrosine into dopamine but not norepinephrine, alpha-MSH, beta-MSH or LVP had no such effect. Similar treatment with ACTH 4-10 or ACTH 1-24 increased striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity measured in vitro, but did not significantly alter the enzyme activity from other brain regions. We conclude that ACTH peptides can stimulate protein and dopamine metabolism in mouse brain and that LVP has no such effects.","Neurochemical responses of mice to ACTH and lysine vasopressin.

pubmed23n0001_784,Sarcotubular anomalous rectification of frog sartorius muscle.,"The membrane site responsible for anomalous rectification was determined in frog sartorius muscle fibers. The total current-voltage relation of glycerol-treated fibers which represents mainly the properties of the sarcolemma was linear for membrane potentials between about -90 and -50 mV. Thus moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification in intact fibers represents a property of the sarcotubular system. The absence of slow hyperpolarization in glycerol-treated fibers was caused by the abolition of early conductance increase, and the sarcotubular system is responsible for the inward rectifier. Picrotoxin selectively inhibited both moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification and hyperpolarization-induced early conductance increase. This suggests that the same component in the sarcotubular system is responsible for these conductance changes. The inhibition with picrotoxin of moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification suggests the possibility that it is caused by an electrogenic effect rather than a decrease in K conductance. A sarcolemmal hyperpolarization-activated slow conductance increase was revealed.","Sarcotubular anomalous rectification of frog sartorius muscle.

The new enzyme was purified to a single homogeneous protein from the 105 000 g-supernatant fraction of guinea-pig liver by (NH4)2SO4 fractional precipitation and two gel-filtration stages, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. It was characterized by many properties. The enzyme has almost the same properties as the classical testosterone 17beta-dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.64), with respect to cofactor requirement, pH optima for dehydrogenation, effect of phosphate ion on the NAD+-dependent reaction and molecular weight, but characteristic differences were observed in substrate-specificity between the two dehydrogenases. With various androstane derivatives, the configuration of the A/B-ring junction was closely connected with enzyme activity. 5alpha-Androstanes, such as 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol, 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol and 17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-3-one, and 5beta-congeners, such as 5beta-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol, 5beta-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol and 17beta-hydroxy-5beta-androstan-3-one, served as substrates for both the EC 1.1.1.64 enzyme and the new enzyme.

These enzymes were rapidly inactivated at similar rates and in 1:1 stiochiometry by reaction with DAN in the presence of cupric ions. The pH profiles of inactivation of these enzymes were similar and had optima at pH 5.5 to 6. They were also inactivated at similar rates by reaction with EPNP, with concomitant incorporation of nearly 2 EPNP molecules per molecule of enzyme. The pH profiles of inactivation were again similar and maximal inactivation was observed at around pH 3 to 4. Some of the EPNP-inactivated enzymes were treated with DAN and shown still to retain reactivity toward DAN. All these enzymes were inhibited strongly by pepstatin, and the reactions of DAN and EPNP with them were also markedly inhibited by prior treatment with pepstatin. These results indicate that the active sites of these enzymes are quite similar and that they presumably have at least two essential carboxyl groups at the active site in common, one reactive with DAN in the presence of cupric ions and the other reactive with EPNP, as has already been demonstrated for porcine pepsin and calf rennin. Pepstatin appears to bind at least part of the active site of each enzyme in a simmilar manner.","The structure and function of acid proteases. V.

pubmed23n0001_4757,Metalloproteases of human articular cartilage that digest cartilage proteoglycan at neutral and acid pH.,"Extracts of human articular cartilage contain proteases capable of degrading the proteoglycan component of cartilage matrix at neutral and acid pH. These enzymes have been partially purified by ion exchange chromotography and characterized by disc electrophoresis, inhibition patterns, and action of proteoglycan. Three distinct metalloproteases are described. A neutral protease that digests proteoglycan subunit optimally at pH 7.25 has been purified up to 900-fold. It is strongly inhibited by o-phenanthroline, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and egg white, and to a lesser extent by D-penicillamine and EDTA. Inhibition by chelating agents is reversed by cobalt, zinc, and ferrous ions. Two acid metalloproteases, distinct from cathespins B1, D, and F, digest proteoglycan subunit at pH 4.5 and 5.5. Both are inhibited by o-phenanthroline and activity is restored by cobalt, zinc, or ferrous ions. With electron microscopy, it was found that cartilage slices were depleted of ruthenium red-staining matrix proteoglycan after incubation in vitro with a partially purified cartilage extract at neutral pH. Sedimentation, gel chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and immuno-diffusion studies of digests of isolated proteoglycan fraction produced by the partially purified cartilage extract at neutral and acid pH confirmed that the cartilage enzymes act only on the protein component of proteoglycan subunit, producing fragments with 5 to 12 chondroitin sulfate chains. The link proteins were not digested.","Metalloproteases of human articular cartilage that digest cartilage proteoglycan at neutral and acid pH.

pubmed23n0001_546,Trans-synaptic regulation of the development of end organ innervation by sympathetic neurons.,"To examine the regulation of development of end organ innervation the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), and two of its target organs, the iris and pineal gland, were studied using biochemical and histofluorescent approaches. During postnatal ontogeny the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH), which is localized to adrenergic neurons, increased 50-fold in iris, and 34-fold in pineal nerve terminals of the rat. These increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) uptake, a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane. These biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation, adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber fluorescence intensity as determined by fluorescence microscopy. Unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the SCG in 2-3-day-old rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation: T-OH activity, [3H]NE uptake, innervation density, plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in irides innervated by decentralized ganglia. It is concluded that trans-synaptic factors regulate the maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals, and the development of end organ innervation by SCG.","Trans-synaptic regulation of the development of end organ innervation by sympathetic neurons.

pubmed23n0001_6408,Competitive inhibition by lithium and hydrogen ions of the effect of calcium on the aggregation of rabbit platelets.,"ADP-induced platelet aggregation and shape change were monitored optically in citrated rabbit platelet-rich plasma (PRP) diluted with isotonic salt solutions. Lithium (Li) produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the rate of platelet aggregation but had no discernible effect on the shape change which precedes aggregation. When PRP was pre-incubated with Li, the inhibitory effect of the ion was independent of the duration and temperature of the treatment. The inhibitory effect of Li also was observed in heparinized PRP or when 5-HT was used as the aggregation-inducing agent. When Li was combined with aggregation inhibitors which enhance platelet cyclic AMP content either by activating adenylate cyclase or by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, only additive effects were observed. The inhibitory effect of Li was opposed by added calcium. Kinetic evaluation of the interaction between Li and Ca indicated that their antagonism was competitive. Added calcium also displayed competitive antagonism toward the aggregation inhibiting effect of increased hydrogen ion concentration in the pH range between 6 and 8.","Competitive inhibition by lithium and hydrogen ions of the effect of calcium on the aggregation of rabbit platelets.

pubmed23n0001_6799,In vitro inhibition of rho-aminohippurate transport by halogenated anesthetics.,"The effects of four commonly used halogenated anesthetic agents (methoxyflurane, halothane, enflurane and fluroxene) on rho-aminohippurate (PAH) uptake by rabbit renal cortical slices were examined. All agents depressed PAH uptake in a linear dose-dependent manner after 60 minutes of incubation and the effect was reversible. When the data were normalized for anesthetic potency, all agents exhibited a parallel dose-response curve. Since these agents do not share a common metabolite, it is concluded that the depression of PAH transport is mediated primarily by a direct effect of the agents acting through a common pathway. Exposure of kidney slices to perithreshold concentrations of halothane and enflurane for 180 minutes did not result in a cumulative inhibitory effect on PAH transport. A slight time-dependent effect was seen with methoxyflurane. It is suggested that with prolonged exposure metabolic conversion of methoxyflurane may occur leading to further inhibition of PAH uptake.","In vitro inhibition of rho-aminohippurate transport by halogenated anesthetics.

pubmed23n0001_6912,Structure and assembly of filamentous bacterial viruses.,"Filamentous bacterial viruses are flexible nucleoprotein rods, about 6 nm in diameter by 1000-2000 nm in length (depending on the virus strain). A protein shell encloses a central core of single-stranded circular DNA. The coat protein subunits forming the shell are largely alpha-helix, elongated in an axial direction, and also sloping radially, so as to overlap each other and give an arrangement of subunits reminiscent of scales on a fish. This arrangement of alpha-helices is rather like some models of myosin filaments. An early step in assembly of the virion is the formation of a complex between the viral DNA and an intracellular packaging protein that is not found in completed virions. Newly synthesized coat protein becomes associated with the plasma membrane of the cell. During the final steps of assembly, the packaging protein is displaced from the DNA and replaced by coat protein as the virion passes out through the plasma membrane of the host cell.","Structure and assembly of filamentous bacterial viruses.

The first patient had a distal acidifying defect. Circumstantial evidence has been presented suggesting that exposure to toluene-diisocyanate or toluene-diamine played a role in the pathogenesis. The acidosis and the hypokalemia of this patient were easily corrected by the administration of small amounts of sodium bicarbonate without potassium supplementation. The second patient had an interstitial nephritis of unknown etiology and presented with moderate renal insufficiency, renal tubular acidosis, and proximal as well as distal acidifying defects. The proximal tubular dysfunction was associated with general aminoaciduria and glucosuria. This patient required large quantities of both alkali and potassium to correct the electrolyte abnormalities. The mechanisms of potassium wasting in proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis are reviewed. A classification is presented of cellular defects that may underlie the different renal acidifying defects. Attempts to distinguish between pump and permeability defects from urinary pCO2 levels must take into account the simultaneous HCO-3 concentration, since large pCO2 elevations require the presence of ample HCO-3 in the urine. Permeability defects may impair urinary acidification by either abnormal back flux of H+ out of the lumen or increased influx of HCO-3 into the lumen. In studies of acidification in vitro, amphotericin B causes increased H+ permeability and has little effect on HCO-3 permeability. Toluene-diamine causes a marked permeability defect which is reversible, but remains to be defined in terms of the ion species, HCO-3 or H+, affected. At times, hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by distal defects in net acid excretion that occur without impairment of the H+ gradient. In certain patients with hypoaldosteronism, for example, distal H+ secretion may be reduced without change in the force of the H+ pump.","Nephrology rounds, University of Iowa Hospitals: renal tubular acidosis.

The intensity of this rotation can be modulated by administration of various dopaminergic and cholinergic agents. Injection of alpha-methylparatyrosine methylester (125 mg/kg) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg) inhibited the ipsilateral circling behavior. Pimozide (1 mg/kg) also inhibitied the rotation, but to a lesser extent. The injection of the anticholinergic agent trihexyphenidyl (5 mg/kg) potentiated, and the cholinomimetic drug arecoline (5 mg/kg), depressed the rotation induced by PCP (7.5 mg/kg), It is probable that PCP possesses significant dopaminergic and anticholinergic properties. The capacity of PCP to induce rotation in this model may be related to its effects on dopaminergic and cholingergic neurons in the rat striatum. Thus, PCP may induce rotational behavior by potentiating dopaminergic transmission, by blocking cholinergic activity, or both; both of these effects have been demonstrated to be important in the generation of circling behavior in rats with nigrostriatal lesions.","Phencyclidine-induced rotational behavior in rats with nigrostriatal lesions and its modulation by dopaminergic and cholinergic agents.

pubmed23n0001_7899,Effect of palytoxin on membrane and potential and current of frog myelinated fibers.,"Palytoxin is a highly toxic compound isolated form several zoanthid Palythoa species. The effects of palytoxin on the nodal membrane of frog myelinated fiber have been studied under current clamp and under voltage clamp conditions. Under current clamp conditions, palytoxin (0.1 microng/ml, 3 x 10(-8)M) induces a depolarization which is not reversed by washing. The resting potential reaches a value of -35 mV after 10 minutes. During the same period, the evoked action potential shows a gradual decline and finally disapears after about 30 minutes. The membrane depolarization is suppressed by removal of Na ions from the external medium, but only slightly diminished when tetrodotoxin (10(-6)M) is subsequently added to the external medium. When the potential of the nodal membrane is maintained at -70 mV, palytoxin (0.1 microng/ml) causes the appearance of an inward current that increases in magnitude during 30 minutes before attaining a steady-state value. The kinetics of development of that current is modified in the presence of tetrodotoxin or saxitoxin. Voltage clamp analysis shows that palytoxin causes an increase of the resting sodium permeability that is accompanied by a shift of the voltage dependence of the transient sodium permeability in the direction of membrane hyperpolarization. The shift in the voltage dependence of the transient permeability is accompanied by a decrease of the peak transient permeability. A similar shift in the potential dependence of the sodium inactivation is observed. During and after the application of palytoxin, the internal sodium concentration increases. The steady-state (potassium) conductance is also decreased at the same time as the leak current is increasing.","Effect of palytoxin on membrane and potential and current of frog myelinated fibers.

These fluctuations were paralleled by increased ornithine concentrations, although the mean plasma levels of this amino acid remained far below those of arginine, i.e., 0.73 and 0.22 mmole/liter after 30 and 90 min, respectively. When expressed on a molar basis, arginine administration resulted in an almost stoichiometric rise in urinary urea excretion. These findings indicate that arginine is rapidly metabolized via urea and ornithine, the latter being transformed to glucose, as evidenced by a significant rise in the blood glucose concentration. Blood gas analyses and serum urea and blood ammonia concentrations determined after the load showed no significant deviations from preinfusion levels. Thus, in contrast to the effects to be expected form studies with tissue culture homogenates, even when administered to newborn infants, arginine does not impair the turnover of the urea cycle.","Effects of arginine infusion in infants: increased urea synthesis associated with unchanged ammonia blood levels.

pubmed23n0001_3676,Light-driven proton translocations in Halobacterium halobium.,"The purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium acts as a light-driven proton pump, ejecting protons from the cell interior into the medium and generating electrochemical proton gradient across the cell membrane. However, the type response of cells to light as measured with a pH electrode in the medium consists of an initial net inflow of protons which subsides and is then replaced by a net outflow which exponentially approaches a new lower steady state pH level. When the light turned off a small transient acidification occurs before the pH returns to the original dark level. We present experiments suggesting that the initial inflow of protons is triggered by the beginning ejection of protons through the purple membrane and that the initial inflow rate is larger than the continuing light-driven outflow. When the initial inflow has decreased exponentially to a small value, the outflow dominates and causes the net acidification of the medium. The initial inflow is apparently driven by a pre-existing electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which the cells can maintain for extended times in the absence of light and oxygen. Treatments which collapse this gradient such as addition of small concentrations of uncouplers abolish the initial inflow. The triggered inflow occurs through the ATPase and is accompanied by ATP synthesis. Inhibitors of the ATPase such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) inhibit ATP synthesis and abolish the inflow. They also abolish the transient light-off acidification, which is apparently caused by a short burst of ATP hydrolysis before the enzyme is blocked by its endogenous inhibitor. Similar transient inflows and outflows of protons are also observed when anaerobic cells are exposed to short oxygen pulses.","Light-driven proton translocations in Halobacterium halobium.

pubmed23n0001_6517,Pharmacological basis for antihypertensive effects of intravenous labetalol.,"Labetalol 1-5 mg/kg administered intravenously to normal subjects in the supine position produced an immediate mean fall in systolic (16%) and diastolic (25%) blood pressure with a concomitant increase in heart rate (12%). After graded exercise, intravenous labetalol inhibited increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Isoprenaline log dose response curves of increase in heart rate and reduction in diastolic pressure after intravenous labetalol shifted to the right in a parallel manner compared with pre-labetalol response curves suggestive of competitive antagonism at beta-adrenoceptor sites. Similarly, phenylephrine dose response curves of increase in systolic pressure before and after intravenous labetalol were suggestive of competitive antagonism at alpha-adrenoceptor sites. The ratio of relative potency alpha: beta adrenoceptor antagonism after intravenous labetalol was approximately 1:7, whereas in the same subjects after oral labetalol the ratio was approximately 1:3 as previously reported. Using the inhibition of isoprenaline tachycardia to estimate the potency of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonism of labetalol relative to that of propranolol the potency ratio was 1:6. However, using inhibition of Valsalva tachycardia as the index, the estimated ratio was approximately 1:3.

pubmed23n0001_4745,Aspartate transcarbamylase of Escherichia coli. Heterogeneity of binding sites for carbamyl phosphate and fluorinated analogs of carbamyl phosphate.,"Some preparations of both native aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli and catalytic subunit have fewer tight binding sites per oligomer for carbamyl-P than the number of catalytic peptide chains. In contrast, the number of sites for the tight-binding inhibitor N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate does equal the number of catalytic chains in each case. Binding of the labile carbamyl-P was determined using rapid gel filtration, with conversion to stable carbamyl-L-aspartate during collection. Native enzyme (six catalytic chains) obtained from cells grown under the conditions of J.C. Gerhart and H. Holoubek (J. Biol. Chem. (1967) 242, 2886-2892) has 5.4 tight sites for carbamyl-P at pH 8.0 (KD = 9.9 muM), whereas native enzyme from cells grown with higher concentrations of glucose, uracil, and histidine (to yield more enzyme per unit volume of culture) has only 1.9 tight sites at pH 8.0 (KD = 4.6 muM) and only 2.3 tight sites at pH 7.0 (KD = 2.6 muM). At pH 8.0, catalytic subunit (three catalytic chains) obtained from the former native enzyme has 2.2 tight sites for carbamyl-P (KD = 2.4 muM) and the number of sites is 2.3 in the presence of 35 mM succinate, whereas catalytic subunit obtained from the latter native enzyme has 1.8 tight sites (KD = 3.6 muM) in the absence of succinate and 2.3 tight sites in its presence. The number of tight binding sites is also less than the number of subunit peptide chains in 19F nuclear magnetic resonance experiments performed with catalytic subunit and two fluorinated analogs of carbamyl-P at comparable concentrations of analogs and active sites.

In addition, the distribution of the glial transport system for glycine is shown to parallel the presumed distribution of glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Results of these studies also suggest that transport studies on brain homogenates or synaptosomal preparations do not serve to localize these functions to synaptic elements as is widely believed. This report shows that glia can form vesicles during homogenization which band which synaptosomes in density gradients, and retain transport activity. Glia also may contribute to the release of neurotransmitters via control of the extracellular Ca++ concentration.

Gasometric investigations of arterial blood.,"The purpose of the present work was to assess the effect of trasylol--an inhibitor of proteases--and heparin on gasometric values in arterial blood during cardio-respiratory resuscitation. The investigations were carried out on rabbits in three experimental groups. In group I the simplest resuscitation procedures were applied: artificial respiration with AMBU self-expanding bag and heart massage. In group II oxygen was given for respiration, heart massage was applied, cardiac, vasoactive and alkalinizing drugs were given. Group III received the above drugs and procedures but trasylol and herparin were used additionally. Cardiac arrest was obtained by means of acute hypoxia following suxamethonium administration. The investigations showed that in groups I and II despite resuscitation management arterial hypoxaemia and metabolic acidosis persisted while in group III a certain return of normal gasometric values was observed and the animals in this group survived the experiment.","Use of protease inhibitor (trasylol) and heparin in cardiorespiratory resuscitation.

pubmed23n0001_444,Preservation of hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in canine pneumococcal pneumonia.,"To determine the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pneumococcal pneumonia, hemodynamic measurements were made in 16 dogs before, and within 36 hours after, intrapulmonary administration of type III pneumococcus. Ten dogs with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary vascular resistances and slightly decreased their arterial O2 tensions. Hypoxia increased and hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances. During O2 breathing, arterial PO2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung. In 2 dogs breathing air, forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by O2 breathing. In 5 dogs, lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia. In pneumococcal pneumonia, the hypoxic pulmonary pressor mechanism serves to decrease blood flow to the diseased lobes and, thus, to maintain the arterial PO2. Lung mast cells could participate in this response.","Preservation of hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in canine pneumococcal pneumonia.

pubmed23n0001_3705,The influence of food on nitrofurantoin bioavailability.,"The effect of food on the absorption of five commercial dosage forms of nitrofurantoin varying widely in drug release and dissolution characteristics was assessed in man after oral administration. Four healthy fasting and nonfasting male subjects received, in a crossover fashion, a single 100-mg dose of microcrystalline nitrofurantoin as an aqueous suspension, three different compressed tablets, and a single 100-mg dose of macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin in a capsule. Both the absorption and the duration of therapeutic urinary concentrations of nitrofurantoin were significantly increased after administration of the five products to nonfasting subjects. The enhancement in the bioavailability of the drug in the presence of food ranged from 20% to 400%, with the greatest absorption-enhancing effect occurring with those dosage forms exhibiting the poorest dissolution characteristics. It is concluded that single-dose comparative bioavailability studies of drug products normally administered with food should be performed in both nonfasting and fasting subjects.","The influence of food on nitrofurantoin bioavailability.

pubmed23n0001_641,A micro-method for quantitative determination of acylneuraminic acids from erythrocyte membranes.,"A micro-method is presented which enables the fast and exact determination of acid-hydrolyzed acylneuraminic acids in erythrocyte membranes. Erythrocytes from 1 ml of human and rabbit blood containing ACD buffer are, washed and hemolyzed on Millipore filters of pore size 1.2 mu. Acylneuraminic acids are released from the erythrocyte membranes still on the filters under the optimal conditions of 0.1 N HCl at 80 degrees C for 50 min. A prerequisite for the determination of the true amount of acylneuraminic acids using the periodic acid/thiobarbituric acid assay is the small-scale extraction of lipids from the hydrolysate and anion-exchange chromatography of acylneuraminic acids. The values thus obtained must be corrected, as 20% of acylneuraminic acids are destroyed during acid hydrolysis. In samples of human blood from 10 healthy individuals, on an average 223 nmol acylneuraminic acids per ml of packed erythrocytes were found, and in the same amount of rabbit erythrocytes, 1e method for a screening of the acylneuraminic acid content of erythrocyte membranes in hemolytic diseases or of other cell membranes is discussed.","A micro-method for quantitative determination of acylneuraminic acids from erythrocyte membranes.
